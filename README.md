# Verilog-Code-CS203
these are all the coding assignments done in CS203 course

# Instructions for running lab$_$$.v
#### 1. Run testbench.v and lab$_$$.v together.
#### 2. lab2 is a simple xor gate
#### 3. lab3 is binary adder and different methods are used.
#### 4. lab4 is a logic tile and switch box implementation.

# Instructions for running FPGA of Lab5
#### 1. run testbench.v and FPGA.v together.
#### 2. The configure.mem file contains configurational data for FPGA.
#### 3. This FPGA is a shift register. This is built using Logic tiles and switch box.

# Instructions for running FPGA of Lab6
#### 1. This FPGA can do Binary Shift operation (Left or Right), Add operation and multiplexer operation.
#### 2. To do shift operation run shifter.v and FPGA.v together. the configuration file for FPGA is shift.mem
#### 3. To do Multiplexer operation run muler.v and FPGA.v together. the configurational file for FPGA is mul.mem
#### 4. To do Addition Operation (Binary Coded Decimal) operation run bcder.v and FPGA.v together. the configurational file for FPGA is bcd.mem
#### 5. This FPGA is also built entirely on Logic Tiles and switch boxes of same specifications throughout.
